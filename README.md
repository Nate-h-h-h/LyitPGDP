This repo on GitHub is with my Python walkthrough work that has me creating a test branch and merging it back into the main repo. A branch in Git is a separate copy of my repository that allows you to make changes to my code without affecting the main branch. This is useful for testing out new features or fixing bugs without impacting the stability of the main codebase.

I can use the test branch to try out a new feature or make changes to my code, and then merge those changes back into the main branch once me I am satisfied with the results.

Overall, my first-time using GitHub with my python code samples was a valuable learning experience that introduced me to version control and collaboration tools. It allowed me to safely make changes to my code and share my work with the community.
